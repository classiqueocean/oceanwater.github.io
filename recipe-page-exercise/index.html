            The viral Onion-wrapped Burger from In-N-Out at home and even 
            better! No bread buns but you won't be missing them at all. The 
            onions are caramelized to perfection, filled with umami flavor, and
            way better than lettuce or tomato-wrapped burgers!

        <h1>Instructions</h1>
        <ol>
            <li>
                MAKE THE SPREAD: In a small bowl, mix together the 
                mayonnaise, relish, ketchup, sugar, and vinegar. It will 
                be a pink color. Set aside.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                PREPARE THE PATTIES: Weigh out 8 portions of 3 to 4 oz of 
                ground beef or eye it out. Gently flatten the patty into a 
                circle to desired thin or thickness, making sure to not mix
                or mold it too much. Sprinkle with salt and pepper on both 
                sides. Set aside.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                MAKE CARAMELIZED ONION BUNS: In a large pan or flat grill 
                over medium to medium-low heat, add vegetable oil. Once hot,
                add the onions and sprinkle with sugar and salt. Cook for 
                a few minutes until you see the edges turn golden. Flip 
                over gently and caramelize the other side. Right before 
                you take them off the grill, add cheese to half the 
                grilled onions.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                COOK AND ASSEMBLE THE BURGER: Over medium-high heat in a 
                skillet or pan, add vegetable oil and/or butter. Add the
                patties in and optional, add 1 teaspoon of mustard on the 
                raw side and spread evenly. It will take about 2-3 minutes
                for the patty to get a nice brown crust. Flip over and 
                add a slice of American cheese on top of half the patties.
                Let it cook for about 1 more minute. Add one patty without 
                cheese on top of the patty with cheese to create a double 
                double burger. Transfer this stack on top of a grilled 
                onion and add a grilled onion with cheese on top as the bun.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Serve with spread to enjoy warm!
            </li>
        </ol>
