                <p>
                    Our rescue journey started when we got our very first 
                    hedgehog. I knew I wanted to adopt our first hedgehog and 
                    give a home to one who really needed one. One day on 
                    classifieds, someone had posted they had a hedgehog and they
                    just needed him gone asap. That same night. My heart ached 
                    for this little guy who was about to be displaced. He was 
                    free so I knew everyone would try to get him just because 
                    he was free. We had done our research for years (four to be
                    exact)! We were active in the military and always moved 
                    and had lived in California most of the time where they were
                    illegal. I knew we would be a great home for him because we
                    had so much love to give.  It was never the right time but
                    all of a sudden the timing was perfect when I read that 
                    craigslist ad. We left right away and drove two hours in 
                    Miami traffic. The little guy we picked up was super grumpy 
                    and we fell in love with him as soon as we saw him. My son 
                    named him Benjamin. Benji for short. As time went on I saw 
                    more hedgehogs needing homes. We already had one so two 
                    wouldn't be be that much harder. Soon, we found ourselves 
                    taking in hedgehogs and finding them new homes. Some come to
                    us in great condition. Others have medical problems and some
                    have stayed with us because they have been neglected and 
                    abused and are very timid. Hedgehogs need specific care and 
                    not too many people or small animal rescues know proper 
                    husbandry for this species. That's why we specialize in 
                    rescuing hedgehogs only. I have done dog, cat/kitten, 
                    reptile and small animal rescues for the last 20 years but 
                    hedgehogs have a special place in my heart.  We take in 
                    hedgehogs needing homes, and take care of them until they 
                    are ready to go to their forever homes. No hedgehog is ever
                    denied. We are proud to be active members in hedgehog 
                    communities nation wide. Please feel free to take a look 
                    around our website. Thank you.
