            <b>Crown Shyness</b>
            (also <i>canopy disengagement</i>),<sup>[1]</sup>
            <i>canopy shyness</i>,<sup>[2]</sup> or <i>inter-crown spacing</i>
            <sup>[3]</sup> is a phenomenon observed in some tree species, 
             in which the crowns of fully stocked trees do not touch each other,
             forming a canopy with a channel-like gaps.<sup>[4]</sup>
             <sup>[5]</sup> The phenomenon is most prevelant among trees of 
             the same species, but also occurs between trees of different 
             species.<sup>[6]</sup><sup>[7]</sup> there exist many hypothese as
             to why crown shyness is an adaptive behavior, and research suggests
             that it might inhibit spread of leaf-eating insect larve.

            The exact physiological basis of crown shyness is uncertain. 
            <sup>[6]</sup> The phenomenon has been discussed in scientific 
            literature since the 1920s.<sup>[9]</sup> The variety of hyptheses
            and experimental results might suggest that there are multiple
            mechanisms across different species, an example of covergent
            evolution.<sup>citation needed</sup>

            Some hypotheses contend that the interdigration of canopy branches
            leads to "reciprocal pruning" of adjacent trees: trees in windy 
            areas suffer physical damage as they collide with each other during
            winds; the abrasions and collisons induce a crown shyness response.
            Studies suggest that lateral branch growth is largely uninfluenced
            by neighbors until disturbed by mechanical abrasion.<sup[10]</sup>
            If the crowns are artifically prevented from colliding in the winds,
            they gradually fill the canopy gaps.<sup[11]</sup> This explains
            instances of crown shyness between branches of the same organism.
            Proponents of this idea cite that shyness is partially seen in 
            conditions conducive to this pruning, including windy forests, 
            stands of flexible trees, and early succession forests where 
            branches are flexible and limited in lateral movemnet.<sup>[6]</sup>
            <sup>[12]</sup> According to this theory, variable flexiblity in 
            lateral branches greatly influences the degreee of crown shyness.
