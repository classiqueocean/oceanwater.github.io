                <p> Vodun cosmology centers around the vodun spirits and other 
                    elements of divine essence that govern the Earth, a 
                    hierarchy that range in power from major deities governing 
                    the forces of nature and human society to the spirits of 
                    individual streams, trees, and rocks, as well as dozens of 
                    ethnic vodun, defenders of a certain clan, tribe, or nation.
                    The vodun are the center of religious life. Perceived 
                    similarities with Roman Catholic doctrines such as the 
                    intercession of saints and angels allowed Vodun to appear 
                    compatible with Catholicism, and helped produce syncretic 
                    religions such as Haitian Vodou. Adherents also emphasize 
                    ancestor worship and hold that the spirits of the dead live
                    side by side with the world of the living, each family of 
                    spirits having its own female priesthood, sometimes 
                    hereditary when it is from mother to blood daughter. 
                    There is also an underlying philosophical framing 
                    underpinning Vodun which, according to Suzanne Preston 
                    Blier, who undertook a year of research in 1985–86 in 
                    Abomey and the nearby area, highlights the importance of 
                    remaining calm in contexts of difficulty and in life more
                    generally. According to Blier, Vodun means, "the idea of 
                    staying close to a water source, to not rush through life
                    , to take time to attain tranquility." Her interpretation
                    stems from two area diviners who maintain that its 
                    origins lie in the phrase "rest to draw the water", 
                    from the Fon verbs vo 'to rest', and dun 'to draw water'
                    , the stoic suggestion of "the need for one to be calm and 
                    composed" in the face of adversity.[1]

                </p>
                <p> Patterns of Vodun worship follow various dialects, spirits, 
                    practices, songs, and rituals. The divine Creator, called 
                    variously Mawu or Mahu, is a female being. She is an elder 
                    woman, and usually a mother who is gentle and forgiving. She
                    is also seen as the god who owns all other gods and even if 
                    there is no temple made in her name, the people continue to 
                    pray to her, especially in times of distress. In one 
                    tradition, she bore seven children. Sakpata: Vodun of the 
                    Earth, Xêvioso (or Xêbioso): Vodun of Thunder, also 
                    associated with divine justice,[2] Agbe: Vodun of the Sea, 
                    Gû: Vodun of Iron and War, Agê: Vodun of Agriculture and 
                    Forests, Jo: Vodun of Air, and Lêgba: Vodun of the 
                    Unpredictable.[3]

                <h3 class=" heading-3">The Priestess</h3>
                <p> The Queen Mother is the first daughter of a matriarchal 
                    lineage of a family collective. She holds the right to lead 
                    the ceremonies incumbent to the clan: marriages, baptisms 
                    and funerals. She is one of the most important members of 
                    community. She will lead the women of a village when her 
                    family collective is the ruling one. They take part in the 
                    organisation and the running of markets and are also 
                    responsible for their upkeep. This is vitally important 
                    because marketplaces are the focal points for gatherings and
                    social centres in their communities. In the past when the 
                    men of the villages would go to war, the Queen Mothers would
                    lead prayer ceremonies in which all the women attended every
                    morning to ensure the safe return of their menfolk.
                    The high priestess is the woman chosen by the oracle to care
                    for the convent. Priestesses, like priests, receive a 
                    calling from an oracle, which may come at any moment during
                    their lives. They will then join their clan's convent to 
                    pursue spiritual instruction. It is also an oracle that will
                    designate the future high priest and high priestess among 
                    the new recruits, establishing an order of succession within
                    the convent. Only blood relatives were allowed in the 
                    family convent; strangers are forbidden. In modern days, 
                    however, some family members enter what is described as the 
                    first circle of worship. Strangers are allowed to worship 
                    only the spirits of the standard pantheon.

                <h3 class="heading-3">Queen Mothers</h3>
                <p>Queen mothers were once important political figures who 
                   commanded respect prior to the colonial era.[7] However, the 
                   delegation of roles to these figures varied: in some 
                   instances, they were considered to be autonomous rulers,[8] 
                   in others, they had specific jurisdiction over "women's" 
                   issues (or issues that involved both men and women together, 
                   such as rape, adultery and marital conflict),[1] in others 
                   still, they were simply the literal mothers of prominent 
                   figures, and afforded all the status therein.
                   Colonists from Europe, due to their own sexism, negotiated 
                   only with titled men in the areas that they operated in. 
                   Queen mothers in Africa, essentially, were not recognized as 
                   important and were often referred to in colonial/missionary 
                   historical documents as "sisters" of the men in power.[6] 
                   The denial of status these women faced facilitated their 
                   titles' losses of power[7] - hence, under colonial rule, 
                   Queen mothers, like other women on the continent, lost 
                   "social, religious, constitutional, and political privileges 
                   and rights."[9]

                <p>Historical records reveal the names of various deities who 
                   were worshiped in Voodoo. Prominent among them were Blanc 
                   Dani, the Grand Zombi, and Papa Lébat. These were venerated 
                   at altars, where sacrifices were made to them. Spirits of 
                   the dead also played a prominent role in historical Voodoo, 
                   with some contemporary practitioners regarding the religion 
                   as a form of ancestor worship. Historical accounts suggest 
                   that in the 19th century, the saints played a prominent role,
                   although amid the 20th-century revival, the veneration of 
                   deities from other African diasporic religions became common.
                   The production of charms, which are known as gris-gris, plays
                    an important part.
                   From the early 18th century, enslaved West Africans—the 
                   majority of them Bambara and Kongo—were brought to the 
                   French colony of Louisiana. There, their traditional 
                   religions would have syncretized with the Roman Catholic 
                   beliefs of the French. This continued as Louisiana came under
                   Spanish control and was then purchased by the United States 
                   in 1803. In the early 19th century, many migrants fleeing the
                   Haitian Revolution arrived in Louisiana, bringing with them 
                   Haitian Vodou, which contributed to the formation of 
                   Louisiana Voodoo. Although the religion was never banned, its
                   practice was restricted through a range of laws regulating 
                   when and where black people could gather. Practiced secretly,
                   it spread up the Mississippi River to Missouri. During the 
                   19th century, practitioners such as Marie Laveau, attracted 
                   considerable attention. By the early 20th century, the public
                   practice of Voodoo had heavily declined. After the 1960s, the
                   New Orleans tourist industry increasingly used references to 
                   Voodoo to attract visitors, while a Voodoo revival took 
                   place, the practitioners of which often drew heavily on other
                   African diasporic religions such as Haitian Vodou and Cuban 
                   Santería.
